The instructor's notes are used as the main text for the course. However, the following textbooks are also useful.

Grading
-------

The grading will be based on five problem sets (40%) and a final exam (60%). In each problem set, there will be one problem that is to be graded, and several other problems that are not for a grade. I encourage you to work on the problem sets together, but you need to write your solution to the problem for a grade by yourself. Although the other problems are not for a grade, I encourage you to work on them and submit your solutions for feedback.
